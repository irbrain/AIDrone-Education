# Find the desired object using YOLO v5

### 1. Collecting Images with Drones:
1) Gather images captured using drones.
2) Perform labeling for each image to prepare the dataset.
3) Use tools that support labeling in the YOLO format, such as:

### 2. Training Optimization:
#### Adjust the learning rate as needed (default: 0.01).
#### Set the batch size according to the available GPU memory.
#### Use an image resolution of 640x640 as a starting point (can be modified as necessary).

### 3. Performance Monitoring:
#### Utilize TensorBoard to monitor the training process in real-time.
#### Check the mean Average Precision (mAP) to assess model performance.
#### Regularly evaluate for signs of overfitting to maintain model generalization.

### 4. Inference and Evaluation:
#### Use the provided inference.py script for testing and making predictions.
#### Experiment with different confidence threshold values to find the optimal settings.
#### Conduct evaluations in real-world scenarios to validate model performance.

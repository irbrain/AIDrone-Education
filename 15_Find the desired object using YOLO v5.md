# Find the desired object using YOLO v5

### 1.Dataset Preparation:
#### Ensure a minimum of 100 images per class to build a robust dataset.
#### Include images captured under varied environments and conditions to enhance model generalization.
#### Split the dataset into training and validation sets, with a recommended ratio of 80:20.

### 2. Training Optimization:
#### Adjust the learning rate as needed (default: 0.01).
#### Set the batch size according to the available GPU memory.
#### Use an image resolution of 640x640 as a starting point (can be modified as necessary).

### 3. Performance Monitoring:
#### Utilize TensorBoard to monitor the training process in real-time.
#### Check the mean Average Precision (mAP) to assess model performance.
#### Regularly evaluate for signs of overfitting to maintain model generalization.

### 4. Inference and Evaluation:
#### Use the provided inference.py script for testing and making predictions.
#### Experiment with different confidence threshold values to find the optimal settings.
#### Conduct evaluations in real-world scenarios to validate model performance.

# AIDrone Product Introduction

The AIDrone is an advanced educational drone designed for coding and AI learning, integrating cutting-edge sensors and computing technology.

The NRF51822-based flight controller (FC) board is equipped with an ICM-20602 (gyro sensor), SPL06 (barometric sensor), PMW3901MB (optical flow sensor), and VL53L0X (ToF distance sensor), enabling precise flight control and accurate environmental awareness. 

Additionally, a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a camera module allows for advanced AI capabilities and video processing.

The drone supports block coding applications and allows users to program it using Scratch 3 or Python. 

This makes it accessible for students and hobbyists to code and pilot the drone while enhancing creativity and logical thinking.

The coding drone competitions and AI drone challenges offer practical project experiences and fun, interactive AI learning opportunities.
